            <p> 
                Acid Mammoth is a doom metal band from Athens, Greece. The band was formed in 2015 by Chris Babalis Jr. (Vocals & Guitars) and Dimosthenis Varikos (Bass), good friends since high school, with a deep love for Sabbath and other heavy music. After a series of jams and recordings, they were joined by their very good friend Marios Louvaris (Drums) and Chris Babalis Sr. (Guitars), Jr.'s father.

                In late 2016, the band recorded its self-titled, debut full-length album, which they self-released digitally in autumn of 2017. The album was mixed and mastered by Dionysis Dimitrakos of Descent Studios in Athens while drums were recorded at Wudsound Studios. The album art was designed by popular Greek comic artist Yiannis "Rubus" Rubulias. The album was released digitally on Bandcamp on October 6th, 2017.
