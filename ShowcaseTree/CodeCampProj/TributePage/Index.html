                        <li>Born Diederick Kastner in Hargendorf, a village in the Empire province of Nordland.</li>
                        <li>Mixed Norscan and Nordlander heritage. His mother was an Empire innocent, his father a possesed champion of the Varg tribe.</li>
                        <li>After the death of his mother, he was addopted by a local Sigmarite Priest and become a Knight-Templar of the Order of the Twin-Tailed Orb.</li>
                        <li>Fought bravely and fiecely for Sigmar. But once his true heritage and destiny were revealed to him, Diederick Kastner despaired and looked for salvation. He traveled to the massive Holy Temple of Sigmar in Altdorf.</li>
                        <li>Asking the golden statue of Sigmar for a sign of salvation, Diederick received no reply.</li>
                        <li>He renounced Sigmar, but still hatred the dark gods of his father, and accepted his dark destiny as vengeance for his fate.</li>
                        <li>His deeds legend and his armies vast, innumerable foes of dauntless might lie bleeding in his calamitous stride. But deep inside, he wholly resents the Chaos Gods and the misery they have brought upon him.</li>
                        <li>The half-Norscan warlord stood ready to fulfil his destiny and to usher at the end of all things, and in the very end, he faced Sigmar in battle, the very god of his people that he had once called lord, and of all Mankind.</li>
